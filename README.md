# Hack The Box Beginner Writeups

## Overview
This repository documents my practical journey into ethical hacking and cybersecurity through Hack The Box (HTB) machines. 
Each write-up demonstrates the methodology, tools, and techniques used to solve beginner-friendly challenges, focusing on **problem-solving, enumeration, and privilege escalation**.

---

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to:
- Showcase structured approaches to HTB machines.
- Highlight the tools, techniques, and methodologies used.
- Track my progress in cybersecurity fundamentals as an aspiring Security Analyst.

## Machines
Each machine has a dedicated Markdown file in the `Machines/` folder:
- **[Machine-01](Machines/Machine-01.md)** – Beginner-friendly Linux exploitation
- **[Machine-02](Machines/Machine-02.md)** – Web application enumeration
- …and more as I progress.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Network and port enumeration using Nmap
- Directory and service enumeration
- Basic privilege escalation on Linux machines
- Documentation of methodology and findings

---

## Notes
- All exercises are performed on Hack The Box (legal environments) only.  
- No IP addresses, credentials, or sensitive data are included.  
- Focus is on methodology, learning, and reproducible problem-solving approaches.
