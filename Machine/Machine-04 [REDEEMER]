# Redeemer Write-up
**Prepared by:** dotguy

## Overview
This write-up focuses on the HTB Redeemer machine, which teaches how to interact with a **Redis server** and retrieve data securely.  
The emphasis is on understanding **in-memory databases**, enumeration, and basic Redis commands while developing fundamental penetration testing skills.

## Key Learnings

### 1. Understanding Databases and Redis
- Learned what databases are and their importance in real-world environments.  
- Redis is an **in-memory key-value database**:
  - Stores data in RAM for **fast retrieval**.  
  - Often used for **caching frequently requested data**.  
  - Can persist data to disk for backup.  
- Redis helps improve **application performance** by reducing load on traditional databases.

---

### 2. Setting Up Connectivity
- Verified connectivity to the target machine using `ping`.  
- Conducted a preliminary scan with **Nmap** to identify open ports and running services:
```bash
nmap -sV {TARGET_IP}
Found port 6379 (Redis) open, which became the main entry point.

3. Using Redis CLI
Installed redis-cli to interact with the Redis server:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install redis-tools
redis-cli -h {TARGET_IP}
Learned the importance of CLI tools for server interaction.

Explored basic Redis commands:

info → Retrieve server statistics

select <db> → Switch between logical databases

keys * → List all keys in the database

get <key> → Retrieve the value of a key

4. Enumeration and Key Retrieval
Learned how to enumerate a Redis database:

Identify databases (keyspaces) and number of keys.

Explore keys and retrieve stored values.

Understood how careful exploration can reveal critical information (like flags in HTB machines).

5. Key Takeaways
Understanding the underlying technology before exploitation is critical.

Learned how enumeration, scanning, and CLI tools work together in penetration testing.

Gained experience in methodical exploration to locate sensitive data.

Reinforced that research, observation, and structured methodology are more important than speed.

Conclusion
The Redeemer machine strengthened foundational skills in:

Database enumeration

Command-line interaction

In-memory database concepts

It emphasized the value of structured exploration, careful observation, and technology-specific tool usage in cybersecurity.
