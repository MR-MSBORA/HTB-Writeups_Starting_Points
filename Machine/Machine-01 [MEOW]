## Overview
This write-up highlights the practical skills and lessons learned from the Hack The Box (HTB) Meow machine.  
The focus is on **learning fundamental penetration testing concepts**, understanding tools, and building problem-solving skills.

---

## Key Learnings

### 1. Setting Up and Connectivity
- Connected to HTB labs using **Pwnbox**, a browser-based virtual machine preconfigured for hacking challenges.  
- Learned to use **OpenVPN** to connect from a personal virtual machine:
  - Download the VPN configuration file from HTB.  
  - Connect using a terminal or VPN client.  
  - Verify connectivity by pinging the target machine:
    ```bash
    ping {TARGET_IP}
    ```
- Developed the skill of **checking network connectivity** and ensuring the lab environment is stable before starting.

---

### 2. Enumeration Skills
- Learned the importance of **enumeration**: discovering open ports and running services.  
- Practiced **port scanning** with **Nmap** to identify services:
    ```bash
    nmap -sV {TARGET_IP}
    ```
- Learned how different services (Telnet, web servers, file shares) can be **entry points**.  
- Understood that **documentation during enumeration** is critical to avoid missing attack vectors.

---

### 3. Understanding Vulnerabilities
- Explored **Telnet**, an older remote management protocol, to understand its security weaknesses.  
- Learned the concept of **default usernames and blank passwords** as potential footholds.  
- Understood that vulnerabilities often arise from **misconfigurations or outdated services**.

---

### 4. Exploitation and Foothold
- Practiced **gaining initial access** by testing common usernames with blank passwords.  
- Learned the importance of **persistence and methodical testing**, even when initial attempts fail.  
- Developed the skill of exploring directories to locate **sensitive files**, like the flag.

---

### 5. Capturing Flags and Verification
- Learned how to locate target files (e.g., `flag.txt`) and extract contents:
    ```bash
    cat flag.txt
    ```
- Understood that flags in HTB serve as **proof of success** and encourage structured problem-solving.  
- Realized that completing a machine involves **research, critical thinking, and systematic methodology**, not just memorizing commands.

---

## Takeaways
- Penetration testing is mostly about **research, observation, and careful methodology**.  
- Each step—setup, enumeration, foothold, and verification—builds **practical problem-solving skills**.  
- Beginner machines like Meow build confidence and foundational skills for:
  - Web exploitation  
  - Privilege escalation  
  - Automation and scripting  
  - Security assessment in real-world scenarios

---

**Conclusion:**  
The Meow machine reinforced **fundamental penetration testing concepts**, including lab setup, connectivity, enumeration, vulnerability assessment, foothold acquisition, and flag capture. It emphasized **persistence, research, and structured methodology** in cybersecurity.
